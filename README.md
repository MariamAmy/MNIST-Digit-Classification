# MNIST-Digit-Classification: Project Overview
A convolution neural network to classify the MNIST dataset with ~98% accuracy
* Loaded the data from keras dataset API as numpy arrays (the data was already split in train and test)
* Casting the data into float32 to be scaled later into values between [0, 1]
* Built the Sequential using the high-level Keras API built TensorFlow
* Built the model architecture using Keras Neural Network Layers
* Compiled the model using Categorical Loss and Adam optimizer (for momentum optimization to speed up the training)
* Trained the model for five epochs, using the test-set as the cross validation-set ()
* Re-ajusted the model hyperparameters to reach ~98% accuracy
